One of the first prototypes of Steam Machine, the Xi3 Piston mini-PC, was reviewed in detail on the Bringus Studios YouTube channel. This PC of 2013 runs Windows instead of the Linux-based SteamOS operating system. According to Bringus Studios’ tests, the PC that Xi3 later released under the name Piston has mediocre gaming performance, and even at the time it was not very fast. The Xi3 Piston has an AMD Trinity processor and 8 GB of RAM. This chip is called R-464L, but it is actually an analog of the 2012 AMD A10-4600M. But the most interesting part of the computer can be seen not from the inside, but from the outside. This is a combined DisplayPort and HDMI connector.

Apple’s next generation iPad Pro is expected to be announced in the next few weeks without a separate event. What should we expect from the long-awaited new devices?  iPad Pro 2022 received a minor update that added the M2 processor, Apple Pencil hovering function, as well as specification updates such as Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. In recent years, the iPad Pro has generally only received relatively minor updates, but the next generation could be the first major update to the product since 2018 that will bring «fundamental changes». MacRumors collected the most important rumors about new devices. Updated, slimmer design. Since 2018, the iPad Pro has maintained the same design for four consecutive generations. Numerous reports indicate that the biggest design change for the new models will be a significant reduction in thickness — from 5.9 mm to 5.1 mm and from 6.4 mm to 5.0 mm, respectively. CAD renders indicate that there will be no other major design changes, but there are vague reports that the device will have a landscape front-facing camera like the 10th generation iPad, which is much more natural for video calls when using the Magic Keyboard.
Insider Kopite7kimi has shared some new details about the upcoming NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards. Earlier, he claimed that the flagship of this line would receive a 512-bit memory bus, but a few months later this information was denied in favor of information about a 384-bit bus. Now Kopite7kimi is talking about the 512-bit variant again, without going into details. It is likely that NVIDIA is considering different variants of the memory specification, which is why different information from insiders appears. More importantly, Kopite7kimi claims that the new GeForce RTX 50 series will use GDDR7 memory with a bandwidth of 28 Gbps, which is significantly faster than GDDR6X. At the same time, NVIDIA will still have a lot of room for future upgrades, as GDDR7 memory is capable of reaching speeds of over 32 Gbps.
During the Q&A session, dedicated to the Apple Car Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman touched on several other topics, including the fact that Apple has «begun formal development of» a new MacBook Pro with an M4 processor. However, he did not provide any additional details about the yet-to-be-announced chip. Apple introduced the M1 Mac processor in November 2020, followed by the M2 in June 2022, and the M3 chip in late October 2023, i.e. at intervals of about a year and a half. If this trend continues, M4 will be released in the first half of 2025. However, if the interval is reduced to one year, it could be released in late 2024, transmits MacRumors. The last time Apple updated MacBook Pro lineup in October, presenting M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max processors. As part of this update, Apple discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Pro and replaced it with a new base model, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip. Apple has also updated the iMac and MacBook Air with the M3 chip, leaving the Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro as the only current-generation computers still equipped with M2 chips.

The Steam Deck OLED console has shown little burn-in after a 1500-hour stress test conducted by YouTuber Wulff Den. Although 1500 hours or 63 days is a long time, the OLED version of the Steam Deck experienced burn-in much faster than the Switch OLEDwhich, as Wulff Den demonstrated earlier, burned out in about 3500 hours. Since the inception of OLED displays, the problem of image retention, called burn-in, has been critical. However the latest OLED panels have a better design that should reduce the risk of burnout. The YouTuber decided to compare Steam Deck OLED with Switch OLED. Both devices are almost identical at the subpixel level, and the displays may come from the same manufacturer.
In January, Xiaomi introduced POCO X6 Pro to the industry. The new iteration of the «popular» smartphone has an adequate price tag, modern design, and powerful hardware, but as usual, there are nuances with the camera. We’ve already tested the new product, played with it, taken photos, etc., and are finally ready to share our impressions. 
To celebrate the Galaxy Ring’s unveiling at MWC in Barcelona last week, Samsung created an infographic with a complete history of her wearable devices. Samsung’s journey to wearables started back in 1999 with the SPH-WP10 — the world’s first commercial watch. A year later, text input and voice dialing functions were added to the device, while the Watch Phone of 2003 already had a color OLED display. At the same time, the real push to the smartwatch market came in 2013 with the release of the Gear. Since then, Samsung has released several versions, including the Gear S3 in 2016, which secured the company’s second place in the global wearables market in the first quarter of 2017. Over the past two and a half decades, Samsung has continued to improve its wearables. The Galaxy Watch 6 series is the culmination of all these efforts, along with the Galaxy Fit3, and the Galaxy Buds2 Pro is the real champion of the Korean company so far. As for the latter device — smart ring for «better health» Galaxy Ring — then it should be officially presented at the next Samsung Unpacked event, which may take place in early to mid-July in Paris (Galaxy Z Fold6 and Z Flip6 will be presented there). Samsung Vice President Hong Park noted that Galaxy Ring will monitor sleep patterns based on heart rate, movement, and breathing, and provide reports and advice to users. The company will also collect data from Natural Cycles, which already tracks menstrual cycles and ovulation through the Galaxy Watch. 
According to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is planning to release a 20-inch MacBook laptop with a folding screen. This will happen in about 3 years. «The only foldable Apple product with a clear development schedule is the 20.3-inch MacBook, which is expected to go into mass production in 2027,» Kuo wrote, without providing any further details. Ming-Chi Kuo is the third source to mention the possibility of a 20-inch MacBook. Earlier, this was reported by display industry analyst Ross Young and Korean website The Elec. The largest laptop Apple currently sells is the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The company also once offered a 17-inch MacBook Pro, which was discontinued in 2012. The new foldable MacBook would have a screen that provides dimensions of approximately 20 inches diagonally when fully deployed. But it is not known what the screen will have when it is minimized.
Microsoft has announced an online presentation of Surface, Windows, and Copilot that will take place in two weeks. The event New era of work will take place on March 21. It is aimed at Microsoft business customers and will feature new devices Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 for business, as we reported earlier this week, with a focus on the upcoming AI improvements in Windows 11. The commercial versions of Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 will differ in minor specifications. Microsoft will also offer consumers an OLED display on the Surface Pro 10, which the company is expected to reveal later this spring, reports The Verge. The new Surface Laptop 6 could be the most interesting device yet, thanks to a new design that reportedly includes thinner display bezels, rounded corners, a haptic touchpad, and two USB-C and one USB-A ports. Microsoft is rumored to be shipping Intel Core Ultra and Snapdragon X Elite-based Surface models, with the Intel-based models expected in April and the Arm —-based models in June.
This year, Google’s Tensor G4 mobile processor (SoC) will be released, which will be the basis for the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and possibly the Pixel Fold 2. New information from Korea confirms previous rumors that the G4 will be manufactured at Samsung’s 4nm fab. The Tensor G4 will have improved heat management and better performance and higher efficiency. It looks like it will be a step up from the G3 in every possible way, transmits GSMArena. Interestingly, the Exynos 2400, which is installed in Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S24 and S24+ (in some markets), will also be produced at the same factory. So far, we can say that Google, and several other major players (including Mark Zuckerberg of Meta and Open AI CEO Sam Altman) are trying to become less dependent on Taiwan’s TSMC, which currently holds about 50% of the market.
Samsung rejuvenated the OLED TV market when its display subsidiary Samsung Display announced QD-OLED technology two years ago. Quantum Dot (QD) OLED panels promised richer colors than LG Display’s white OLED panels (WOLED) and presented a viable competitor to what had become the only option for OLED TVs. Various companies, from Samsung Electronics to Sony, touted the advantages of QD-OLED over WOLED. Today, this has changed. Samsung’s 2024 OLED TV lineup will include TVs with both QD-OLED and WOLED panels. Samsung started doing this last year with the 83-inch S90C. But this year, it will be even more difficult to determine whether Samsung’s new OLED TV has quantum dots, reports Arstechnica. Samsung announced the entry-level S85D, S90D, and flagship S95D models in January without specifying the type of OLED panels. But it’s clear that the S90D will have WOLED panels, as Samsung said it will be available in 42-, 48-, 55-, 65-, 77-, and 83-inch sizes. QD-OLED is not available in 42, 48, or 83 inches.
At the beginning of the year, we already wrote about the new 65% keyboard Varmilo Minilo VXT67 with nice timing, but no software. And before that, it was Varmilo VCS87 Cliff-Bot. Now it’s the turn of the Varmilo VPE87 Chang’e — it’s another dream come true for fans of mechanical keyboards with Asian aesthetics, quick-change switches, and various connection options. We’ve been using this model for several weeks, so we’re ready to draw conclusions, share our impressions, experiences, etc.
The video card market continued its recovery in Q4 of last year. Shipments grew by 6.8% compared to Q3 2023 and by 32% compared to Q4 2022, according to the company’s report Jon Peddie Research. While both Nvidia and AMD increased their sales on a quarterly and year-over-year basis, AMD grew more, and its market share now stands at 19%. While sales of discrete GPUs grew in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, shipments declined sharply in 2022, likely due to a weakening global economy as some countries slipped into recession, transmits Tom’s Hardware. However, 2023 was a year of sales recovery, and Q4 continued this trend, showing a 6.8% increase in shipments. In Q4 2023, the company shipped 32% more discrete GPUs than in Q4 2022.
Research company Canalys has published a report on the state of the smartphone market in the fourth quarter of 2023, broken down by processor vendors. The analysis showed that in the last quarter of last year, Mediatek chips were used in more devices than processors from other suppliers. Compared to the same period last year, Mediatek demonstrated a 21% increase in shipments. Although Mediatek was the leader in terms of the number of chips sold, Apple generated the largest revenue. Smartphones with Apple chips (iPhone only) brought the American company $87 billion, which is 20% more than in the same period last year. Mediatek, Apple, and Qualcomm were the top three mobile chipset vendors on the market, while Huawei-owned HiSilicon generated $7 billion in revenue for 7 million units sold. This means that the Chinese company sold mainly nova 12 and Mate 60 smartphones with Kirin 9000S chips at an average price of $1000. 
However, the Pixel 8a will be more expensive than its predecessor. The price of the Pixel 7a is $499, and the new Pixel 8a model is expected to have a price tag of €569.90, which is approximately $618. The version with increased storage will be even more expensive at €630 (about $684). In this case, the «budget» Pixel 8a will not differ too much in terms of price from the regular Pixel 8 with a price of $699. Although the price may still change. The Pixel 8a will be available in Obsidian (black), Porcelain (beige), Bay (light blue), and Mint (light green) colors. Last year’s Pixel 7a was also available in four colors, but only in the 128GB version. The only option for variety was a version with 5G mmWave support, which is offered by some operators for $50 more. For now, it is said that only the black version of the phone will have a 256GB storage option. Previous leaks have indicated the 8a will have a similar form factor and design to the other already released Pixel 8 phones. It is also likely to get the same Tensor G3 chip and 8 GB of RAM as the Pixel 8. The differences will be in size. The Pixel 8a is rumored to have a 6.1-inch display.
ASUS Republic of Gamers (ROG) has announced the launch of a relatively thin and light gaming laptop ROG Zephyrus G16 (2024) in Ukraine. The device has a new aluminum body and Slash Lighting matrix backlight on the lid. It looks like a diagonally running ribbon and demonstrates customizable animated effects. The new ASUS ROG Zephyrus G16 (2024) can be equipped with a 16-core (22 threads) Intel Core Ultra 7 155H (up to 4.8 GHz) or Core Ultra 9 185H (up to 5.1 GHz) processor, which uses the Intel AI Boost NPU unit. The system also includes up to 32 GB of LPDDR5X-7467 MHz RAM (on the board), two M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 SSDs with a total capacity of up to 4 TB, and a discrete NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, RTX 4070, or RTX 4090 graphics card for laptops.
The mobile phone as a device was invented twice: In 1973, when Martin Cooper called Joel Engel «wirelessly» and in 2007, when Steve Jobs introduced the first Apple iPhone. Since then, the world has never been the same. People are immersed in social networks and endless consumption of video/photo content, all thanks to a large touchscreen made using capacitive technology. After 2007, push-button smartphones became extinct, but in this article (or rather a series of articles) we will not talk about their collapse, but rather about the best of times, about the heyday of mobile technology before the Apple iPhone era. Let’s go back to the years when designers were not afraid of experiments, and technologies surprised every year. Back then, the market was regularly replenished with mobile phones that were imprinted in the memory and became legends. Let’s recall the heyday of such operating systems as Symbian, Windows Mobile, Palm OS, BlackBerry OS, and talk about the best phones and smartphones from 2000 to 2006. Let’s start «digging» with the year 2000, for several good reasons. It was in the third millennium that the development of mobile phones became exponential: no sooner did the phone come out than it became outdated, and every year manufacturers surprised the most demanding techno-fans and the whole world. This is not the case with the progress of wireless phones from 1990 to 2000, where changes were more minor and quite smooth. In the 21st century, cameraphones appeared, color displays became the norm, and smartphones penetrated deeper into the masses. So, in this issue, we will recall the best models of 2000-2001, briefly describing each of them.
Microsoft plans to unveil new Surface devices in late March. Sources familiar with the plans said that the company will unveil the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6, which are aimed at business and commercial customers, on March 21. It calls them AI PCs («AI PC»). The devices will be equipped with new Intel Core Ultra or Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite-based processors that feature the latest neural processors (NPUs) to enhance AI capabilities. They are said to be roughly on par with the iPad Pro and MacBook Pro in terms of efficiency and performance, transmits Engadget. The Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 are expected to be among the first devices to support the upcoming Windows 11 AI features. Along with support for the Copilot feature on the device, these features will include live signatures and real-time translations, zooming and upscaling for games, updated Windows Studio effects, and something that (at least for now) is called AI Explorer. The latter feature may be what distinguishes AI computers from ordinary ones. AI Explorer will apparently work in any application and will allow you to search for documents, web pages, images, and chats using natural language. It is believed that this feature will create a history of everything you do on your computer and make it searchable. The tool is able to understand the context and offer tasks based on what is displayed on the screen. AI Explorer is also expected to support text-based image editing. These AI features are likely to come as part of the 24H2 update for Windows 11, which will be released this fall. As for what else we can expect from Microsoft’s next laptops, both are said to have all-day battery life. Surface Pro 10 is expected to have an OLED screen with anti-reflective coating and HDR support. It is rumored to have an ultra-wide-angle webcam on the front and an NFC reader. It is believed that Surface Laptop 6 will receive a more significant redesign compared to its predecessors. In addition to thinner bezels and rounded corners, it is expected to have a tactile touchpad, a dedicated key for Copilot, and an updated port group. It will also be the first Surface Laptop with an Arm processor (in addition to Intel models). The Intel-based versions of Surface Laptop 6 and Surface Pro 10 are expected to ship in April, and the Snapdragon — versions in June.
Nothing has announced the Phone 2A, the company’s third phone, and the first attempt to create a relatively inexpensive device with a «design» approach. The Phone 2A will go on sale starting at €329 for the 8GB RAM and 128GB storage model. The 12GB/256GB version will cost €379. Pre-orders open today, and the device will begin shipping on March 12, transmits The Verge. The Phone 2A is IP54-rated for water and dust resistance and features a 6.7-inch OLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, Gorilla Glass 5 protection, and a 1084 x 2412 pixel resolution. It will be powered by a 5000 mAh battery that supports 45W wired charging (no wireless charging). The Phone 2A is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro processor. The central camera module includes a 50MP main camera with f/1.8 lens and optical stabilization and a 50MP ultra-wide-angle camera with f/2.2 lens. The front camera is 32-megapixel. Three light bars around the rear cameras form the Phone 2A glyph interface to quickly turn off the phone or receive notifications via flashing lights. 
It’s common to see flagship hardware in powerful gaming laptops, but ASUS ROG ZEPHYRUS G16 2024 is nothing like a typical gaming laptop. The slim metal body houses the new Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor paired with a 16 GB NVIDIA RTX 4090 graphics accelerator. Of course, the dimensions cause serious compromises with performance, but let’s talk about that in order. In addition, we tested the screen color palette, battery life, heat, noise, checked the working and gaming performance, and are ready to share our impressions in this detailed review. 
After the current stocks are exhausted, partners will no longer be able to produce new graphics cards with GPUs based on the Turing architecture. As a result, entry-level devices that do not support ray tracing and DLSS acceleration will soon disappear from the market. These graphics cards were the last models in the GTX series, as NVIDIA has completely switched to the RTX brand. According to NVIDIA’s GPU roadmap, the GTX 16 series was completely discontinued in the first quarter of 2024. Currently, all remaining stocks of GPUs are distributed among manufacturing partners. It is estimated that the remaining stock of GTX 16 series devices on the market will be used up within the next 1-3 months. The GTX 1650 and GTX 1630 were the last models on the market. Now, these graphics cards have joined other devices that have been withdrawn from the market before, including the GTX 16 SUPER. Now the lowest level in NVIDIA’s offer is represented by the RTX 20 series. Technically, this makes the mobile RTX 2050 and desktop RTX 3050 the new entry-level models. Despite the discontinuation of GPUs, NVIDIA continues to support the GTX 16 series through new drivers. In fact, the company is still supporting even the GTX 700 series, so owners of GTX 16 graphics cards will continue to receive driver updates for a long time to come.
Following the updated MacBook Air laptops with M3 processors, Apple has announced new color options for MagSafe silicone iPhone cases and Apple Watch bands. The MagSafe silicone case is now also available in mint, sunshine, blue, and pink colors for $49. Apple Watch bands have also received new colors. Sport Loops are now available in mint and blue. Sport Bands — in mint, sunshine, and light blue. The Solo Loop braided strap has been updated with Sunshine, Light Blue, and Raspberry colors, and the Solo Loop strap is now available in Pink, Mint, and Ocean Blue. All of these Apple Watch bands are now available on the Apple website.
Along with the announcement of new models MacBook Air with M3 chip Apple has stopped selling the MacBook Air version with the M1 processor. This laptop was released in November 2020 as the first Mac based on Apple silicon. At the time, it was a kind of revolution. The MacBook Air with the M1 processor was passively cooled, but it provided higher performance and battery life than Intel-based versions. At the same time, Apple reduced the initial price of the 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 processor by $100. For the first time, the price of this device dropped below $1000. The Cupertino-based company released the 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip in June 2022 at an initial price of $1199, but in June 2023, when the 15-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip was released, it reduced the price to $1099. The basic configuration includes 8 CPU cores, 8 GPU cores, 8 GB of unified memory, and 256 GB of internal storage. The MacBook Air lineup now consists of a 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 chip starting at $999, a 13-inch MacBook Air with M3 chip starting at $1099, and a 15-inch MacBook Air with M3 chip starting at $1299.
The upcoming Intel Arrow Lake series of processors, expected to be released by the end of this year, will be the first general Intel lineup for desktops, laptops, and mobile devices to feature cores to accelerate artificial intelligence tasks. The transition to Arrow Lake for desktop computers also means a transition to a new computer platform with the LGA-1851 socket. At the same time, these chips will lose support for DDR4 memory. It is also noted that the next generation of client CPUs is likely to be called Core Ultra 200, or as Intel calls it the second generation Core Ultra. Thus, we should not expect the appearance of 15th generation Core chips. Previous rumors that Intel Arrow Lake processors will lose support for hyperthreading are also confirmed. At the same time, the insider claims that the new processors will not have LP (low-power) E-Core cores, as in Meteor Lake chips. However, they will have a neural processing unit NPU, which should provide similar performance to Meteor Lake. The integrated graphics accelerator will have 4 Xe cores and will be labeled as Intel Graphics. In the case of Arrow Lake-S (desktop day), the graphics should be based on the Xe-LPG architecture, while the mobile version will have the Xe-LPG+ architecture.
Apple announced update of the MacBook Air series. Laptops in the old design are now available with a processor Apple M3.
