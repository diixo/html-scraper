One of the first prototypes of Steam Machine, the Xi3 Piston mini-PC, was reviewed in detail on the Bringus Studios YouTube channel. This PC of 2013 runs Windows instead of the Linux-based SteamOS operating system. According to Bringus Studios’ tests, the PC that Xi3 later released under the name Piston has mediocre gaming performance, and even at the time it was not very fast. The Xi3 Piston has an AMD Trinity processor and 8 GB of RAM. This chip is called R-464L, but it is actually an analog of the 2012 AMD A10-4600M. But the most interesting part of the computer can be seen not from the inside, but from the outside. This is a combined DisplayPort and HDMI connector.

Apple’s next generation iPad Pro is expected to be announced in the next few weeks without a separate event. What should we expect from the long-awaited new devices?  iPad Pro 2022 received a minor update that added the M2 processor, Apple Pencil hovering function, as well as specification updates such as Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. In recent years, the iPad Pro has generally only received relatively minor updates, but the next generation could be the first major update to the product since 2018 that will bring «fundamental changes». MacRumors collected the most important rumors about new devices. Updated, slimmer design. Since 2018, the iPad Pro has maintained the same design for four consecutive generations. Numerous reports indicate that the biggest design change for the new models will be a significant reduction in thickness — from 5.9 mm to 5.1 mm and from 6.4 mm to 5.0 mm, respectively. CAD renders indicate that there will be no other major design changes, but there are vague reports that the device will have a landscape front-facing camera like the 10th generation iPad, which is much more natural for video calls when using the Magic Keyboard.
Insider Kopite7kimi has shared some new details about the upcoming NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards. Earlier, he claimed that the flagship of this line would receive a 512-bit memory bus, but a few months later this information was denied in favor of information about a 384-bit bus. Now Kopite7kimi is talking about the 512-bit variant again, without going into details. It is likely that NVIDIA is considering different variants of the memory specification, which is why different information from insiders appears. More importantly, Kopite7kimi claims that the new GeForce RTX 50 series will use GDDR7 memory with a bandwidth of 28 Gbps, which is significantly faster than GDDR6X. At the same time, NVIDIA will still have a lot of room for future upgrades, as GDDR7 memory is capable of reaching speeds of over 32 Gbps.
During the Q&A session, dedicated to the Apple Car Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman touched on several other topics, including the fact that Apple has «begun formal development of» a new MacBook Pro with an M4 processor. However, he did not provide any additional details about the yet-to-be-announced chip. Apple introduced the M1 Mac processor in November 2020, followed by the M2 in June 2022, and the M3 chip in late October 2023, i.e. at intervals of about a year and a half. If this trend continues, M4 will be released in the first half of 2025. However, if the interval is reduced to one year, it could be released in late 2024, transmits MacRumors. The last time Apple updated MacBook Pro lineup in October, presenting M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max processors. As part of this update, Apple discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Pro and replaced it with a new base model, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip. Apple has also updated the iMac and MacBook Air with the M3 chip, leaving the Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro as the only current-generation computers still equipped with M2 chips.

The Steam Deck OLED console has shown little burn-in after a 1500-hour stress test conducted by YouTuber Wulff Den. Although 1500 hours or 63 days is a long time, the OLED version of the Steam Deck experienced burn-in much faster than the Switch OLEDwhich, as Wulff Den demonstrated earlier, burned out in about 3500 hours. Since the inception of OLED displays, the problem of image retention, called burn-in, has been critical. However the latest OLED panels have a better design that should reduce the risk of burnout. The YouTuber decided to compare Steam Deck OLED with Switch OLED. Both devices are almost identical at the subpixel level, and the displays may come from the same manufacturer.
In January, Xiaomi introduced POCO X6 Pro to the industry. The new iteration of the «popular» smartphone has an adequate price tag, modern design, and powerful hardware, but as usual, there are nuances with the camera. We’ve already tested the new product, played with it, taken photos, etc., and are finally ready to share our impressions. 
To celebrate the Galaxy Ring’s unveiling at MWC in Barcelona last week, Samsung created an infographic with a complete history of her wearable devices. Samsung’s journey to wearables started back in 1999 with the SPH-WP10 — the world’s first commercial watch. A year later, text input and voice dialing functions were added to the device, while the Watch Phone of 2003 already had a color OLED display. At the same time, the real push to the smartwatch market came in 2013 with the release of the Gear. Since then, Samsung has released several versions, including the Gear S3 in 2016, which secured the company’s second place in the global wearables market in the first quarter of 2017. Over the past two and a half decades, Samsung has continued to improve its wearables. The Galaxy Watch 6 series is the culmination of all these efforts, along with the Galaxy Fit3, and the Galaxy Buds2 Pro is the real champion of the Korean company so far. As for the latter device — smart ring for «better health» Galaxy Ring — then it should be officially presented at the next Samsung Unpacked event, which may take place in early to mid-July in Paris (Galaxy Z Fold6 and Z Flip6 will be presented there). Samsung Vice President Hong Park noted that Galaxy Ring will monitor sleep patterns based on heart rate, movement, and breathing, and provide reports and advice to users. The company will also collect data from Natural Cycles, which already tracks menstrual cycles and ovulation through the Galaxy Watch. 
According to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is planning to release a 20-inch MacBook laptop with a folding screen. This will happen in about 3 years. «The only foldable Apple product with a clear development schedule is the 20.3-inch MacBook, which is expected to go into mass production in 2027,» Kuo wrote, without providing any further details. Ming-Chi Kuo is the third source to mention the possibility of a 20-inch MacBook. Earlier, this was reported by display industry analyst Ross Young and Korean website The Elec. The largest laptop Apple currently sells is the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The company also once offered a 17-inch MacBook Pro, which was discontinued in 2012. The new foldable MacBook would have a screen that provides dimensions of approximately 20 inches diagonally when fully deployed. But it is not known what the screen will have when it is minimized.
Microsoft has announced an online presentation of Surface, Windows, and Copilot that will take place in two weeks. The event New era of work will take place on March 21. It is aimed at Microsoft business customers and will feature new devices Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 for business, as we reported earlier this week, with a focus on the upcoming AI improvements in Windows 11. The commercial versions of Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 will differ in minor specifications. Microsoft will also offer consumers an OLED display on the Surface Pro 10, which the company is expected to reveal later this spring, reports The Verge. The new Surface Laptop 6 could be the most interesting device yet, thanks to a new design that reportedly includes thinner display bezels, rounded corners, a haptic touchpad, and two USB-C and one USB-A ports. Microsoft is rumored to be shipping Intel Core Ultra and Snapdragon X Elite-based Surface models, with the Intel-based models expected in April and the Arm —-based models in June.
This year, Google’s Tensor G4 mobile processor (SoC) will be released, which will be the basis for the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and possibly the Pixel Fold 2. New information from Korea confirms previous rumors that the G4 will be manufactured at Samsung’s 4nm fab. The Tensor G4 will have improved heat management and better performance and higher efficiency. It looks like it will be a step up from the G3 in every possible way, transmits GSMArena. Interestingly, the Exynos 2400, which is installed in Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S24 and S24+ (in some markets), will also be produced at the same factory. So far, we can say that Google, and several other major players (including Mark Zuckerberg of Meta and Open AI CEO Sam Altman) are trying to become less dependent on Taiwan’s TSMC, which currently holds about 50% of the market.
Samsung rejuvenated the OLED TV market when its display subsidiary Samsung Display announced QD-OLED technology two years ago. Quantum Dot (QD) OLED panels promised richer colors than LG Display’s white OLED panels (WOLED) and presented a viable competitor to what had become the only option for OLED TVs. Various companies, from Samsung Electronics to Sony, touted the advantages of QD-OLED over WOLED. Today, this has changed. Samsung’s 2024 OLED TV lineup will include TVs with both QD-OLED and WOLED panels. Samsung started doing this last year with the 83-inch S90C. But this year, it will be even more difficult to determine whether Samsung’s new OLED TV has quantum dots, reports Arstechnica. Samsung announced the entry-level S85D, S90D, and flagship S95D models in January without specifying the type of OLED panels. But it’s clear that the S90D will have WOLED panels, as Samsung said it will be available in 42-, 48-, 55-, 65-, 77-, and 83-inch sizes. QD-OLED is not available in 42, 48, or 83 inches.
At the beginning of the year, we already wrote about the new 65% keyboard Varmilo Minilo VXT67 with nice timing, but no software. And before that, it was Varmilo VCS87 Cliff-Bot. Now it’s the turn of the Varmilo VPE87 Chang’e — it’s another dream come true for fans of mechanical keyboards with Asian aesthetics, quick-change switches, and various connection options. We’ve been using this model for several weeks, so we’re ready to draw conclusions, share our impressions, experiences, etc.
The video card market continued its recovery in Q4 of last year. Shipments grew by 6.8% compared to Q3 2023 and by 32% compared to Q4 2022, according to the company’s report Jon Peddie Research. While both Nvidia and AMD increased their sales on a quarterly and year-over-year basis, AMD grew more, and its market share now stands at 19%. While sales of discrete GPUs grew in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, shipments declined sharply in 2022, likely due to a weakening global economy as some countries slipped into recession, transmits Tom’s Hardware. However, 2023 was a year of sales recovery, and Q4 continued this trend, showing a 6.8% increase in shipments. In Q4 2023, the company shipped 32% more discrete GPUs than in Q4 2022.
Research company Canalys has published a report on the state of the smartphone market in the fourth quarter of 2023, broken down by processor vendors. The analysis showed that in the last quarter of last year, Mediatek chips were used in more devices than processors from other suppliers. Compared to the same period last year, Mediatek demonstrated a 21% increase in shipments. Although Mediatek was the leader in terms of the number of chips sold, Apple generated the largest revenue. Smartphones with Apple chips (iPhone only) brought the American company $87 billion, which is 20% more than in the same period last year. Mediatek, Apple, and Qualcomm were the top three mobile chipset vendors on the market, while Huawei-owned HiSilicon generated $7 billion in revenue for 7 million units sold. This means that the Chinese company sold mainly nova 12 and Mate 60 smartphones with Kirin 9000S chips at an average price of $1000. 
However, the Pixel 8a will be more expensive than its predecessor. The price of the Pixel 7a is $499, and the new Pixel 8a model is expected to have a price tag of €569.90, which is approximately $618. The version with increased storage will be even more expensive at €630 (about $684). In this case, the «budget» Pixel 8a will not differ too much in terms of price from the regular Pixel 8 with a price of $699. Although the price may still change. The Pixel 8a will be available in Obsidian (black), Porcelain (beige), Bay (light blue), and Mint (light green) colors. Last year’s Pixel 7a was also available in four colors, but only in the 128GB version. The only option for variety was a version with 5G mmWave support, which is offered by some operators for $50 more. For now, it is said that only the black version of the phone will have a 256GB storage option. Previous leaks have indicated the 8a will have a similar form factor and design to the other already released Pixel 8 phones. It is also likely to get the same Tensor G3 chip and 8 GB of RAM as the Pixel 8. The differences will be in size. The Pixel 8a is rumored to have a 6.1-inch display.
ASUS Republic of Gamers (ROG) has announced the launch of a relatively thin and light gaming laptop ROG Zephyrus G16 (2024) in Ukraine. The device has a new aluminum body and Slash Lighting matrix backlight on the lid. It looks like a diagonally running ribbon and demonstrates customizable animated effects. The new ASUS ROG Zephyrus G16 (2024) can be equipped with a 16-core (22 threads) Intel Core Ultra 7 155H (up to 4.8 GHz) or Core Ultra 9 185H (up to 5.1 GHz) processor, which uses the Intel AI Boost NPU unit. The system also includes up to 32 GB of LPDDR5X-7467 MHz RAM (on the board), two M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 SSDs with a total capacity of up to 4 TB, and a discrete NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, RTX 4070, or RTX 4090 graphics card for laptops.
The mobile phone as a device was invented twice: In 1973, when Martin Cooper called Joel Engel «wirelessly» and in 2007, when Steve Jobs introduced the first Apple iPhone. Since then, the world has never been the same. People are immersed in social networks and endless consumption of video/photo content, all thanks to a large touchscreen made using capacitive technology. After 2007, push-button smartphones became extinct, but in this article (or rather a series of articles) we will not talk about their collapse, but rather about the best of times, about the heyday of mobile technology before the Apple iPhone era. Let’s go back to the years when designers were not afraid of experiments, and technologies surprised every year. Back then, the market was regularly replenished with mobile phones that were imprinted in the memory and became legends. Let’s recall the heyday of such operating systems as Symbian, Windows Mobile, Palm OS, BlackBerry OS, and talk about the best phones and smartphones from 2000 to 2006. Let’s start «digging» with the year 2000, for several good reasons. It was in the third millennium that the development of mobile phones became exponential: no sooner did the phone come out than it became outdated, and every year manufacturers surprised the most demanding techno-fans and the whole world. This is not the case with the progress of wireless phones from 1990 to 2000, where changes were more minor and quite smooth. In the 21st century, cameraphones appeared, color displays became the norm, and smartphones penetrated deeper into the masses. So, in this issue, we will recall the best models of 2000-2001, briefly describing each of them.
Microsoft plans to unveil new Surface devices in late March. Sources familiar with the plans said that the company will unveil the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6, which are aimed at business and commercial customers, on March 21. It calls them AI PCs («AI PC»). The devices will be equipped with new Intel Core Ultra or Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite-based processors that feature the latest neural processors (NPUs) to enhance AI capabilities. They are said to be roughly on par with the iPad Pro and MacBook Pro in terms of efficiency and performance, transmits Engadget. The Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 are expected to be among the first devices to support the upcoming Windows 11 AI features. Along with support for the Copilot feature on the device, these features will include live signatures and real-time translations, zooming and upscaling for games, updated Windows Studio effects, and something that (at least for now) is called AI Explorer. The latter feature may be what distinguishes AI computers from ordinary ones. AI Explorer will apparently work in any application and will allow you to search for documents, web pages, images, and chats using natural language. It is believed that this feature will create a history of everything you do on your computer and make it searchable. The tool is able to understand the context and offer tasks based on what is displayed on the screen. AI Explorer is also expected to support text-based image editing. These AI features are likely to come as part of the 24H2 update for Windows 11, which will be released this fall. As for what else we can expect from Microsoft’s next laptops, both are said to have all-day battery life. Surface Pro 10 is expected to have an OLED screen with anti-reflective coating and HDR support. It is rumored to have an ultra-wide-angle webcam on the front and an NFC reader. It is believed that Surface Laptop 6 will receive a more significant redesign compared to its predecessors. In addition to thinner bezels and rounded corners, it is expected to have a tactile touchpad, a dedicated key for Copilot, and an updated port group. It will also be the first Surface Laptop with an Arm processor (in addition to Intel models). The Intel-based versions of Surface Laptop 6 and Surface Pro 10 are expected to ship in April, and the Snapdragon — versions in June.
Nothing has announced the Phone 2A, the company’s third phone, and the first attempt to create a relatively inexpensive device with a «design» approach. The Phone 2A will go on sale starting at €329 for the 8GB RAM and 128GB storage model. The 12GB/256GB version will cost €379. Pre-orders open today, and the device will begin shipping on March 12, transmits The Verge. The Phone 2A is IP54-rated for water and dust resistance and features a 6.7-inch OLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, Gorilla Glass 5 protection, and a 1084 x 2412 pixel resolution. It will be powered by a 5000 mAh battery that supports 45W wired charging (no wireless charging). The Phone 2A is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro processor. The central camera module includes a 50MP main camera with f/1.8 lens and optical stabilization and a 50MP ultra-wide-angle camera with f/2.2 lens. The front camera is 32-megapixel. Three light bars around the rear cameras form the Phone 2A glyph interface to quickly turn off the phone or receive notifications via flashing lights. 
It’s common to see flagship hardware in powerful gaming laptops, but ASUS ROG ZEPHYRUS G16 2024 is nothing like a typical gaming laptop. The slim metal body houses the new Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor paired with a 16 GB NVIDIA RTX 4090 graphics accelerator. Of course, the dimensions cause serious compromises with performance, but let’s talk about that in order. In addition, we tested the screen color palette, battery life, heat, noise, checked the working and gaming performance, and are ready to share our impressions in this detailed review. 
After the current stocks are exhausted, partners will no longer be able to produce new graphics cards with GPUs based on the Turing architecture. As a result, entry-level devices that do not support ray tracing and DLSS acceleration will soon disappear from the market. These graphics cards were the last models in the GTX series, as NVIDIA has completely switched to the RTX brand. According to NVIDIA’s GPU roadmap, the GTX 16 series was completely discontinued in the first quarter of 2024. Currently, all remaining stocks of GPUs are distributed among manufacturing partners. It is estimated that the remaining stock of GTX 16 series devices on the market will be used up within the next 1-3 months. The GTX 1650 and GTX 1630 were the last models on the market. Now, these graphics cards have joined other devices that have been withdrawn from the market before, including the GTX 16 SUPER. Now the lowest level in NVIDIA’s offer is represented by the RTX 20 series. Technically, this makes the mobile RTX 2050 and desktop RTX 3050 the new entry-level models. Despite the discontinuation of GPUs, NVIDIA continues to support the GTX 16 series through new drivers. In fact, the company is still supporting even the GTX 700 series, so owners of GTX 16 graphics cards will continue to receive driver updates for a long time to come.
Following the updated MacBook Air laptops with M3 processors, Apple has announced new color options for MagSafe silicone iPhone cases and Apple Watch bands. The MagSafe silicone case is now also available in mint, sunshine, blue, and pink colors for $49. Apple Watch bands have also received new colors. Sport Loops are now available in mint and blue. Sport Bands — in mint, sunshine, and light blue. The Solo Loop braided strap has been updated with Sunshine, Light Blue, and Raspberry colors, and the Solo Loop strap is now available in Pink, Mint, and Ocean Blue. All of these Apple Watch bands are now available on the Apple website.
Along with the announcement of new models MacBook Air with M3 chip Apple has stopped selling the MacBook Air version with the M1 processor. This laptop was released in November 2020 as the first Mac based on Apple silicon. At the time, it was a kind of revolution. The MacBook Air with the M1 processor was passively cooled, but it provided higher performance and battery life than Intel-based versions. At the same time, Apple reduced the initial price of the 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 processor by $100. For the first time, the price of this device dropped below $1000. The Cupertino-based company released the 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip in June 2022 at an initial price of $1199, but in June 2023, when the 15-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip was released, it reduced the price to $1099. The basic configuration includes 8 CPU cores, 8 GPU cores, 8 GB of unified memory, and 256 GB of internal storage. The MacBook Air lineup now consists of a 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 chip starting at $999, a 13-inch MacBook Air with M3 chip starting at $1099, and a 15-inch MacBook Air with M3 chip starting at $1299.
The upcoming Intel Arrow Lake series of processors, expected to be released by the end of this year, will be the first general Intel lineup for desktops, laptops, and mobile devices to feature cores to accelerate artificial intelligence tasks. The transition to Arrow Lake for desktop computers also means a transition to a new computer platform with the LGA-1851 socket. At the same time, these chips will lose support for DDR4 memory. It is also noted that the next generation of client CPUs is likely to be called Core Ultra 200, or as Intel calls it the second generation Core Ultra. Thus, we should not expect the appearance of 15th generation Core chips. Previous rumors that Intel Arrow Lake processors will lose support for hyperthreading are also confirmed. At the same time, the insider claims that the new processors will not have LP (low-power) E-Core cores, as in Meteor Lake chips. However, they will have a neural processing unit NPU, which should provide similar performance to Meteor Lake. The integrated graphics accelerator will have 4 Xe cores and will be labeled as Intel Graphics. In the case of Arrow Lake-S (desktop day), the graphics should be based on the Xe-LPG architecture, while the mobile version will have the Xe-LPG+ architecture.
Apple announced update of the MacBook Air series. Laptops in the old design are now available with a processor Apple M3. This chip was previously reserved for the more powerful MacBook Pro line and the latest iMac models, but now it’s also available in the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models. M3 is significantly more powerful than its predecessor, and benchmark tests show a 17% performance boost in single-core tasks and a 21% boost in multi-core tasks. This also applies to the GPU performance, which has increased by about 15 percent compared to the M2, transmits Engadget. Except for the new chip, it’s the same MacBook Air. It looks almost exactly the same as the 2022 model, with the same 13.6-inch screen and a powerful four-speaker speaker system. Likewise, the 15-inch model is essentially identical to the one Apple introduced last summer, except for the M3 upgrade. The 13-inch model comes with 8 GB of RAM as standard. However, the configurator on Apple’s website offers to pay $200 extra for the 16 GB RAM version, and $400 for the 24 GB version. The 15-inch model comes with 16 GB, and you have to pay $200 for an additional 8 GB. Both models are equipped with a 512 GB drive. However, you can order a 1TB and 2TB version. In the traditional increments of $200. There should be new benefits, including, as Apple mentions, support for two external displays when the laptop is closed. The Air 2024 laptop family will also feature Wi-Fi 6E.
Dell executives partially disclosed NVIDIA’s plans to release new devices. It turned out that in 2025, NVIDIA intends to release a new B200 accelerator with high power consumption. Previously, the B200 accelerator was not mentioned in NVIDIA’s roadmap for the past year. It is worth noting that there is a difference between B200 and GB200. NVIDIA has confirmed GB200 as a GPU. At the same time, B200 seems to be the name of an end device. In the 2023 roadmap, the company only mentioned the B100 as a product, but has already introduced the GB200 and GB200NVL GPUs. Although the B200 device has not been officially mentioned by the manufacturer itself, a Dell executive claims that such a product does exist and is expected to hit the market next year.
Apple is working on the fourth generation of the iPhone SE, and with new renders, we have further confirmation that this relatively affordable smartphone will be based on the iPhone 14 model. CAD renders of the new phone published 91mobiles website. According to these reports, the phone will have the body of the iPhone 14 (which is also quite close to the iPhone 13 and iPhone 12), but with a single camera on the back. It is not known whether Apple will keep the outdated 12-megapixel sensor or add a higher resolution camera. Sources confirm that the iPhone SE 4 will have a 6.1-inch OLED display. This is a significant improvement over the 4.7-inch display of the iPhone SE 5G, with a physical button on the front combined with a fingerprint sensor.
The new Intel Core i9-14900KS processor is expected to go on sale around mid-March. However, it is obvious that some retailers are not waiting for the end of the official sales embargo, as photos of the boxes and the processors themselves can already be found online. Core i9-14900KS is a 24-core processor for the LGA1700 platform. It has 8 productive cores (P-Core) and 16 efficient cores (E-Core). The KS suffix stands for Special Edition, which in this case means higher clock speeds and increased power consumption. The new processor will be able to reach 6.2 GHz in automatic overclocking mode (6.0 GHz for the previous top-of-the-line Core i9-14900K model). However, this required an increase in the operating voltage of the chip. The new data shows that Intel Core i9-14900KS needs 1.498 V to reach 6.2 GHz. At the same time, the Processor Base Power has increased from 125 W to 150 W. 
Meta has sent an email to Oculus users informing them that it will delete Oculus accounts on March 29, 2024 and make it impossible to reactivate or receive apps, in-store purchases, store credits, etc. The user will lose their achievements, friends list, and any content created with their Oculus account if they do not switch to a Meta account before then. Oculus accounts have been on their way to being shut down since 2020, when the company, then known as Facebook, started requiring new users to sign up with Facebook accounts. However, in 2022, it added the ability to create a Meta account, offering an alternative to users who did not want to link their Facebook account to the Quest headset, transmits The Verge.
Apple is expected to release several updated models of its devices in the near future, including the iPad Pro and iPad Air tablets, as well as the MacBook Air laptop with the M3 processor. However, it turns out that the company does not seem to be planning to hold a big spring event for announcements. This was reported by Apple expert Mark Gurman. According to him, the company «plans to announce new products on its website through a series of online videos and marketing campaigns». If so, Apple has been skipping the spring event for 2 years in a row, and this year is expected to be especially full of new devices. Whatever the format of the announcements, rumors suggest that they will happen inevitably. Gurman predicts that the new devices will be released either this month or next month. Gurman reports that along with the iPad Pro update and the new 12.9-inch iPad Air, Apple is also planning to announce new Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard accessories. The MacBook Air laptop with the M3 chip is also expected to be released in 13-inch and 15-inch versions.
Recently it became known that Apple has stopped its decade-long efforts to create its own car codenamed Project Titan —, the tech giant was working on an electric car with autonomous driving functions. But this is not the first time Apple has abandoned projects
The Apple Paladin combined a computer, fax machine, scanner, and telephone all in one product. As you can see in the photo of the prototype, the device had a screen and a handset mount. The project was discontinued in the mid-1990s for unknown reasons.
First introduced in 1993, Apple’s WALT (short for Wizzy Active Lifestyle Telephone) was another combination of devices, this time built around a phone. The unreleased phone had a touch screen, caller ID, internal address book, and stylus. It had access to online banking, handwriting recognition, and customizable ringtones. Only a few prototypes were created before the project was terminated.
The AirPower wireless charger, capable of powering three devices simultaneously, was introduced with the iPhone X in 2017. The launch was scheduled for 2018, but was delayed due to heating issues. The delays caused a lot of speculation about its fate until Apple stopped developing AirPower in 2019. 
Apple introduced the MagSafe line of wireless chargers in 2020. A few years later, images of an unreleased MagSafe product known as the Magic Charger began circulating on the Internet. It was a folding metal stand with an integrated MagSafe puck that allowed charging an iPhone in an upright position. It is unclear what happened to the project, but there are many other MagSafe stands available on the market.
Nextorage has released two new 8TB solid-state drives aimed at gaming systems. The NE1N8TB is a member of the G series. It comes in a standard M.2 2280 form factor and has no heat sink. This drive is designed for computers and notebooks. The NEM-PA8TB, on the other hand, is a member of the NEM-PA series, and is equipped with an aluminum heatsink and is more aimed at PlayStation 5 owners. This version can also be used in desktop systems, but you need to make sure you have enough space for the heatsink. Both drives use an eight-channel controller, 2GB DDR4 DRAM cache, and 1200 MT/s 3D TLC NAND memory chips. Nextorage does not disclose the controller model, but it is likely to be a Phison E18. The NE1N8TB and NEM-PA8TB SSDs support PCIe 4.0 and offer the same speeds: sequential read and write speeds of 7300MB/s and 6600MB/s (6900MB/s for 2TB and 4TB models), respectively. I/O operations per second are up to 900,000 IOPS for reads and 100,000 IOPS for writes. Nextorage backs the NE1N8TB and NEM-PA8TB drives with a 5-year warranty and claims a 10,000 TBW endurance. The Nextorage NEM-PA8TB is available now on Amazon for $849.99. The NE1N8TB version can cost $10-15 cheaper.
HP launched a new subscription service that provides a printer for rent (with a certain page limit) and ink for monthly payments. The company says the service should simplify access to printing for families and small businesses (although the agreement includes monitoring by HP and a multi-year commitment). The cost of the cheapest subscription, which includes an HP Envy printer (current model 6020e) and 20 printed pages, starts at $6.99/month. While the most expensive — renting an HP OfficeJet Pro and 700 printed pages — will cost $35.99/month (unused pages can be rolled over to the next month or additional pages can be ordered in case of a shortage). HP promises to deliver ink when it runs out and provide round-the-clock support by phone or chat. The subscription terms state that service «does not cover damage or malfunctions caused by, but not limited to, the use of non-HP media or other products» or if you use your printer more than your plan allows. HP’s attitude toward the use of third-party ink cartridges has been known for a long time — the company blocked this possibility due to micro-updates of printers for which it received a number of lawsuits. The most interesting aspect of the subscription, which the Ars Technica website drew attention to — Requirement for subscribers to support printer connectivity to the Internet (some users avoid this because the device works fine without internet access). Meanwhile, a lack of connection can prevent the installation of the micro updates we mentioned above. The company explains the requirement by saying that through the Internet it will be able to track details important to the subscription (such as the status of ink cartridges, the number of pages used) and «prevent unauthorized use of your account». The All-In-Plan privacy policy (which is the name of the new subscription) also states that HP may «share information about you with advertising partners» so that they can «recognize your devices», deliver targeted advertising, and potentially «combine information about you with information from other companies» with whom HP works. The policy also states that users can opt out of sharing personal information. Another important detail — HP will charge subscribers who cancel their subscription before the end date up to $270 plus taxes (however, the «penalty» will not apply after two years of subscription and returning the leased printer and cartridges within 10 days of cancellation).
The HDMI Forum, the licensing group that oversees the HDMI standard, has notified AMD that it does not allow open source implementations of the HDMI 2.1 (or HDMI 2.1+) specification, blocking tools such as AMD’s FreeSync from working over HDMI connections at resolution/frequency combinations such as 4K at 120Hz or 5K at 240Hz. This can be a problem for Linux users in terms of getting the highest resolution image to the highest frame rate display, at least when it comes to HDMI connections. In January 2021, the Linux blog Phoronix noted that the HDMI Forum does not offer public access to the HDMI 2.1 specification. Alex Deucher, an AMD engineer who has been involved in the development of the company’s open source offerings for a long time, has been maintaining the thread for at least two years and has now reported a negative result, transmits ArsTechnica. In February 2023, Deucher reported that «is working with our [AMD] legal team to figure out what we can do while still meeting our obligations to the HDMI Forum». Two months later, he reported that AMD had launched «with core functionality, now we have to go through each feature with the legal department and determine if we can disclose them without violating our obligations to». The summer and fall of 2023 passed and the legal due diligence was still ongoing, and in October the decision was «in the hands of the HDMI Forum».
Apple’s FineWoven cases for the iPhone 15 have already received several waves of criticism from users, but this time their poor quality has been noted by one of the world’s largest retailers. It turns out that they are so bad that Amazon had to add a warning label — «frequently returned» to FineWoven’s pages. The warning label appears in the product listings for all FineWoven cases from Apple for the iPhone 15, transmits 9to5mac. Apple Watch accessory options and FineWoven MagSafe Wallets do not yet have such a warning. Products that are often returned. Check out product details and customer reviews to learn more about this product.
The Raspberry Pi microcomputer is 12 years old. The first device was released on February 29, 2012 and had an initial run of 10 thousand units. But as demand outstripped supply, more were produced later. Since then, 57 million Raspberry Pi computers and 4 million Raspberry Pi Pico microcontrollers have been sold. According to Raspberry Pi CEO Eben Upton, the best-selling models were the Raspberry Pi 3 boards. The Raspberry Pi 3B/3A+ and 3B+, released between 2016 and 2018, sold 23 million units, approximately 37.7% of total sales. The Raspberry Pi 4 version, released in 2019, was the longest-lasting flagship model, although this was largely due to the pandemic and global chip shortages. From 2019 to the end of 2023, the Pi 4 reigned supreme, followed by the Raspberry Pi 5. The total sales of Raspberry Pi Pico (Pico, Pico W, Pico H, and Pico WH), which cost about $4, do not include the RP2040 system-on-a-chip, which costs $1. 
Immediately after Samsung Galaxy Fold6 design publications it was the turn of its smaller «brother» Flip6. Its design has also become known to the public thanks to OnLeaks and SmartPrix. The likely date of the presentation is in July. The overall form factor of the device is similar to last year’s Flip5including a 6.7-inch internal folding display and a 3.4-inch external screen. However, its thickness may increase from 6.9 mm to 7.4 mm, which raises speculation about what the additional internal space could be used for. The most popular theory comes from last year’s GalaxyClub report, which said that the Flip6’s battery capacity could increase from 3,700 mAh to 4,000 mAh, transmits The Verge. Other rumored specs include a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor and the return of the dual camera. SmartPrix reports that the modules will again have a resolution of 12 megapixels. Samsung has previously been said to be testing a 50MP primary camera in the Flip6, but it’s unclear if it will make it into the final device. The available colors will include light purple and mint green.
ASUS has announced the launch of the Zenbook DUO (2024), an ultraportable laptop equipped with two 14-inch OLED touchscreens with up to 3K resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. With a detachable full-size Bluetooth keyboard, this device offers a variety of uses. According to the manufacturer, the Zenbook DUO is an Intel Evo Edition notebook, which means «unrivaled mobility» in a lightweight 1.35 kg body. Two full-size ASUS Lumina OLED displays with up to 3K resolution, 120Hz refresh rate and 16:10 aspect ratio are connected by a hinge with an opening angle of up to 180°. This allows you to expand your workspace by turning the displays into a single 19.8-inch monitor that can be used in vertical and horizontal orientations in multiple modes – laptop, dual-screen, desktop, collaboration – using ASUS ScreenXpert software. The keyboard with a built-in battery can be detached to fully utilize the visual workspace, or placed on the bottom display to turn it into a regular laptop work panel. The ASUS Zenbook DUO laptop available in Ukraine is equipped with a Bluetooth keyboard that has only Ukrainian and English layouts.

Dozens of ads for renting an Apple headset have appeared on Chinese websites such as Xianyu and Zhuan Zhuan Alibaba Group Holding, according to South China Morning Post. The Vision Pro is currently officially available only in Apple stores in the US for $3500, while rental prices in China start at $13 per hour to $200 per day. Some ads require a deposit of at least $4,000, while others — offer the option to purchase the device after the rental. Beijing-based virtual reality startup Vision Space, which also rents the Vision Pro, says one of its stores received more than 10,000 orders after the device hit the U.S. market, and people were subsequently lining up to use it. Despite the fact that Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the headset «will be available in China soon — the exact date of its appearance is still unknown. However, it is likely that the business of headset rental companies will face problems, as the company itself offers 30-minute demonstrations in its stores. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, prices for «gray» Apple Vision Pro have started to decline — there were offers cheaper than UAH 170 thousand.
At the end of 2023, Tecno released the Spark 20 Pro, an affordable smartphone. We have already received the new product, spent several weeks with it, tested it, took pictures, played with it, etc. I can say right away that the phone is worthy for the money and is a serious competitor to other popular budget models. And all the details, as always, are in the review below. Pluses: modern design; IP53 protection; large package; well-known, powerful (for the segment) and cold chip; a large amount of RAM and built-in memory; it is possible to add virtual memory; 108 megapixel camera; 32 megapixel front camera with separate backlight; 120 Hz screen; stylish software with wide customization options and functions; there is NFC; there is fast charging 33 W; there is stereo sound and support for many audio codecs and DTS. Minuses: faded IPS screen, and most competitors have brighter AMOLED; mediocre battery life; someone will definitely not like the design a la Apple and large protruding modules; lack of any image stabilization when shooting.
You can test the Honda vehicle at the upcoming SXSW conference in Texas. The chair was named UNI-ONE, designed specifically for mixed reality entertainment — a technology that combines the real and virtual worlds to create new environments and visualizations. The UNI-ONE is hands-free — just tilt your torso in a specific direction to move forward, backward or diagonally. The chair has a seat that can be adjusted to suit your needs and can support a passenger weighing up to 110 kg. The vehicle is battery-powered and has a maximum speed of 6 km/h. Honda’s idea is to combine the chair with a mixed reality device so that passengers can comfortably play games or experience other entertainment — including outdoors (for example, participating in racing games in theme parks).
Apple is gradually abandoning the Lightning connector and switching to USB-C after The European Union forced it to do so. Many accessories, iPads, and even iPhones now use USB-C, the AirPods Max headphones are still stuck with Lightning. However, engineer Ken Pillonell (who implemented USB-C in the iPhone and AirPods before Apple) installed a USB-C connector on the headphones and is now selling a kit so that everyone can do the same. Pillonel found that it was easy to knock out the Lightning connector and leave a hole that was the perfect size for USB-C. He then designed a special PCB and found the right connector to make it work. Pillonel managed to charge AirPods Max via USB-C on the first try. Unfortunately, wired USB-C audio is not possible with this modification. Pillonel notes that this requires a chip from Apple’s own adapter, which costs $35, transmits Engadget. The AirPods Max are three years old now, and they are likely due for an update. Any future model will likely have a USB-C connector to comply with EU regulations. However, if you want to work with your existing headphones (or maybe even replace a broken Lightning connector), you can download the circuit and buy all the other necessary parts. Everything is listed in the description of Pillonel’s YouTube video. In addition, you can buy set in the Pillonel store.
Samsung introduced a new generation of microSD memory cards. The company has started testing the memory card microSD SD Express 256 GB card with a sequential read speed of up to 800 MB/s, and announced the start of mass production of 1 TB UHS-1 cards. According to Samsung, the company is the first in the industry to introduce a new high-performance microSD card based on the SD Express interface. The development was the result of successful cooperation with a customer to create a customized product. With its low-power design, embedded software, high performance optimization, and temperature management, the Samsung SD Express microSD card in a small form factor delivers performance equivalent to some SSDs. While most traditional UHS-1-based microSD cards are limited to 104MB/s read speeds, the SD Express has managed to boost this to 985MB/s, a speed that has not been commercially available until now. With sequential read speeds of up to 800MB/s— 1.4 times faster than SATA SSDs (up to 560MB/s) and more than four times faster than traditional UHS-1 memory cards (up to 200MB/s), Samsung’s SD Express microSD card will help speed up applications on PCs and mobile devices. To ensure consistent performance and reliability in a small form factor, Dynamic Thermal Guard (DTG) technology maintains optimal temperature even during extended usage sessions. Samsung’s new 1TB microSD card features eight levels of 8th Generation V-NAND for a total capacity of 1TB, realizing performance previously only possible with SSDs. The new 1TB microSD card «passes the industry’s most rigorous testing» and is protected against water, extreme temperatures, drops, wear and tear, X-rays, and magnetic fields. The claimed protection is valid only for the 1TB UHS-1 microSD card (not for the 256GB SD Express microSD card). It provides for a depth of immersion of 1 meter in salt water for up to 72 hours. Operating temperatures — -25℃ to 85℃), non-operating temperatures — -40℃ to 85℃. The card can withstand standard airport X-ray machines (up to 100 mGy). The magnetic field is equivalent to a powerful MRI scanner (up to 15,000 Gs). The product can withstand drops from a height of up to 5 m and up to 10,000 card changes. A 256GB microSD SD Express card will be available for purchase later in 2024, and a 1TB microSD UHS-1 card will be released in the third quarter of this year.
We’ve found that many users complain of eye fatigue and dryness after using Vision Pro. It’s a statement that’s hard to believe, since people often complain of tired or dry eyes after using various gadgets. Saini says that these are all temporary symptoms — probably caused by people simply not blinking often enough. As for symptoms such as dizziness and nausea, the doctor says they are caused by viewing images in motion, which send the same signals to the brain as you do when you move in life. Eye fatigue (or eyestrain) can be caused by what’s called a conflict between vergence and accommodation. In the real world, when you look at an object, the focal point and the physical distance to that object are the same — but in virtual reality, depth is simulated, so the distance of your eye to the physical screen and the object you are focusing on in the virtual world may not match, leading to eye muscle fatigue. As for the claims of redness and hemorrhaging in the eyes, Saini says they are not dangerous. As a rule, so-called subconjunctival hemorrhages — are harmless and heal on their own. They can be caused by rapid changes in pressure (such as sneezing or coughing), which can lead to bursting of capillaries in the eyes, or by eye trauma. Most VR headset manufacturers warn that their devices are not intended for children under 13 — partly because they are not designed for small bodies, but also because children’s eyes are still developing. For example Meta Quest compliance page It is noted that «children’s bodies are generally less developed, so their eyes, neck, back, and strength do not yet allow them to use Meta Quest comfortably or safely». This is despite the fact that there is no conclusive evidence or enough research to say that using the headset negatively affects children’s vision. But even if headsets do not pose a threat to vision, it does not mean that they cannot hurt the eyes. Manufacturers also offer some tips for comfortable use — on Apple Vision Pro support page recommend using the device with breaks every 20–30 minutes at the beginning of work. Meta says the same thing, adding that experts advise limiting the use of headsets to 2 hours a day. Saini suggests following the 20-20-20 method: take a 20-second break every 20 minutes and look 20 feet (ca. 6 m) into the distance. And if all else fails, you can always buy eye drops. 
During the MWC 2024 exhibition, Nothing provided another small portion of information about its upcoming smartphone Phone 2(a). This time, the company demonstrated the device and introduced its design to the public. The appearance of the smartphone reflects the Nothing design philosophy. The back panel of the device has a characteristic Glyph light, albeit on a smaller scale. You can also see that the camera module is centered at the top of the back panel. The camera unit became one of the key design elements. Below it are design elements reminiscent of roller coaster turns. The transparent back panel has rounded edges. So when you look at the phone from the side, you can see some of the internal parts. Nothing Phone 2(a) will be a more affordable version of the Phone 2, which cost $599. Previous rumors claimed that the new smartphone would cost about €400 in Europe. The cost will be reduced by using a cheaper processor manufactured by MediaTek.
During the Intel Foundry Direct Connect event, the company announced that it plans to launch production/development of the Intel 10A node (1nm analog) at the end of 2027. At the same time, production based on the 14A (1.4 nm) node is scheduled for 2026. The company is also working on creating fully autonomous AI-based fabs in the future. The slide shows the share of silicon wafers the company plans to use for chip manufacturing based on different production processes. In its previous announcements, Intel did not specify a start date for its upcoming 14A node, but has now announced that it will begin production in 2026. More importantly, Intel will begin production/development of its yet-to-be-announced 10A node in late 2027. The suffix A in Intel’s node naming stands for angstrom (a unit of length equal to 10-m or one ten-millionth of a millimeter), and 10 angstroms translate into 1 nm, meaning it is the company’s first 1nm node. Intel did not provide any details about the 10A node, but said that it should deliver double-digit power/performance improvements. The improvement over the 14A node is expected to be 14-15%. Intel plans to aggressively increase its Foveros, EMIB, SIP, and HBI package production capacity. This will ensure a constant supply of advanced processors with complex packaging, including HBM. At the same time, the company intends to expand its operations. In addition to the existing production facilities, Intel plans to invest $100 billion in expansion and new production sites over the next 5 years. Geographically distributed production facilities will allow Intel to have global redundancy of its operations, as well as offer its customers the opportunity to use a supply chain entirely located in America. It is also noted that the company relies heavily on the automation of its production facilities. Intel is now planning to use artificial intelligence in all segments of its production flows, from capacity planning and forecasting to increasing product yields and actual production operations. The timeframe for such changes is not specified, but they should affect every aspect of the company’s operations in the future. This includes the introduction of AI «Cobots» (collaborative robots that can work together with humans) and widespread robotic automation in the production process. 
China’s Honor is working on a smart ring, the company’s CEO George Zhao said the day after Samsung officially announced its Galaxy Ring. Samsung Galaxy Ring is the company’s first attempt in this product category. The device has several sensors that can track health markers like the wearer’s heart rate.
Huawei has released an updated version of its quite popular Watch Fit fitness watch, but added the prefix SE- Special Edition to the name. Although the Huawei Watch Fit SE looks almost the same as the three-year-old model, it has updated sensors, features, and capabilities. We have been testing this fitness bracelet for several weeks, so now we are ready to share our impressions and experience. Pluses: compact and ultra-lightweight body; moisture protection; bright and detailed AMOLED screen; Always-On Display function; adequate step measurement accuracy; 100+ sports modes; a large amount of tracked data; good battery life; fast charging; adequate price/quality/capabilities ratio. Minuses: some people will find the design too inconspicuous, or, conversely, too bright for a fitness tracker; difficulties with replacing the strap; no speaker and microphone.
Samsung is not preparing to launch its new foldable phones until July or August. But already now, a leak has shown a design similar to the final Galaxy Fold6. The device measures 153.5 x 132.5 x 6.1 mm when unfolded. This makes it slightly shorter but noticeably wider than the Galaxy Fold5 (154.94 x 129.8 x 6 mm). The larger width in the expanded format suggests that the screen will also be wider. Other notable details gleaned from these images include the volume buttons and power button (presumably serving as a fingerprint scanner) on the right side, speakers on the top and bottom, and a USB-C port on the bottom.
It has long been rumored that Meta is working on smart augmented reality glasses. It seems that this year we will finally be able to see them. Business Insider cites Meta sources and claims that the company plans to showcase a pair of «real» smart augmented reality glasses this fall at Meta Connect. The glasses are internally named Orion. They are a separate product from the recently released Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and Meta Quest headsets. The publication also reveals that Meta is under a lot of internal pressure to have a high-quality demo, and some company insiders have been experimenting with advanced prototypes. Nevertheless, it seems that Orion glasses are not yet ready to be demonstrated to the public. Business Insider says that even if the glasses are demonstrated at Meta Connect, they will not be available to the general public. Last year, it was reported that the company was planning an «internal» launch of the glasses in 2024, with a public release scheduled for 2027. It is likely that by this time, we will see the third generation of Ray-Ban smart glasses (in 2025), which will receive a «neural interface strip» as an input device. Most likely, the demonstration will be a means of drawing public attention to what is to come in the future. 
The Anker brand offers a new model of wireless over-ear headphones SoundCore H30i. When developing this model, engineers focused on people who constantly use headphones for personal or work purposes.

The SoundCore H30i headphones are equipped with 40mm drivers and a battery that provides up to 70 hours of battery life. With fast charging support, just 5 minutes of recharging can restore the power reserve so that the headset can work for 4 hours. The headset uses Bluetooth 5.3 wireless interface to connect to audio sources. The headset can be used both for listening to music and for communication during calls. Thanks to the Soundcore application, the user can customize their own equalizer settings.
From the beginning, Sony considered niche as one of the key advantages of the $200 PlayStation Portal. Now the company is extremely pleased with the sales and high demand for the portable device, which was created as a complement to PS5, not an alternative to PSP or PS Vita. These and other interesting details were revealed by Sony’s Vice President of Product Management. PlayStation Portal — a gadget for streaming games from PS5, which is, de facto, a modification of DualSense, which was supplemented with an 8-inch display with a resolution of 1080p and a refresh rate of 60 Hz. You can’t run games on it via the «cloud» — only transfer a picture from the PS5. This, as well as the lack of support for Bluetooth accessories, makes PlayStation Portal lose out to full-fledged portables such as Steam Deck and ASUS ROG Ally. Despite the peculiarities and contradictory assessments of specialized MEDIA and ordinary consumers, at the start of sales in November 2013, the entire first batch of PlayStation Portal quickly sold out, and it surprised many people at the time. On the other hand, Sony did not share production plans or detail the size of the first batch. In a conversation with Stephen Totilo, the Sony executive touched upon the success of PlayStation Portal for the first time and at the same time communicated the positioning of the device, which has never claimed to be an alternative to PSP or PS Vita. Ms. Hiromi Wakai demand for PlayStation Portal «continues to exceed expectations» Sony —it is currently difficult to buy the new product, as most stores have run out of the gadget. At the same time, the Sony executive refused to give exact sales figures. «While we can’t share exact figures, demand continues to exceed our expectations», — Totilo quotes Wakai as saying. The Sony vice president also said that the reaction to the announcement was as the company expected — the device has always been seen as a niche device and was intended for users with specific needs. Moreover, even before the start of sales, Sony clearly understood that not everyone would appreciate the Portal’s special niche. From the very beginning, it was designed to be the simplest and most convenient gadget companion that would not require additional efforts from developers. The key goal, according to Hiromi Wakai, is to extend the capabilities of the PS5 (to provide «quality console experience» on a portable screen and without the need to be directly in front of the console), not to completely replace it. 
Acer has announced the launch of three new models of Connect wireless routers in Ukraine, which are sold under the Acer Vero and Predator brands. The new Acer Predator Connect W6 and Vero Connect W6 routers support tri-band (2.4 GHz/5 GHz/6 GHz) Wi-Fi 6E connection and provide up to 7.8 Gbps of bandwidth. At the same time, the Predator Connect W6d model uses dual-band Wi-Fi 6 technology. The routers are equipped with a 2 GHz quad-core MediaTek A53 processor, 1 GB of LPDDR RAM, and 4 GB of storage. The new products can be connected to up to four devices. The coverage area is up to 465 m2 in a mesh network with two mesh devices and up to 930 m2 in a system with four mesh devices. The Predator Connect W6 and Predator Connect W6d feature a set of color-coded LED indicators that show signal strength. This provides greater visibility and allows you to adjust the position of the antennas for the most efficient signal reception and transmission. Acer Connect Vero W6m has a minimalist design. To ensure security, Predator models have a built-in Trend Micro Home Security Engine solution for the entire life cycle. Additionally, it is noted that Acer Connect Vero W6m is the first device to be tested for compliance with EU cybersecurity standards EN 303 645 (RED).
An incredibly affordable controller with a dual mode, good battery life, and lightning-fast connectivity – GamePro MG650 doesn’t claim to be the best, but it’s a great value for the money. We tested the gamepad in synthetic programs, video games, evaluated the ergonomics, and looked for advantages and disadvantages. The GamePro MG650 comes with a controller, a micro USB cable, and a radio receiver. The size of the latter is tiny, but this does not prevent it from picking up the signal well, as we will discuss later. There is no smartphone mount, because the model is not positioned by the manufacturer as a mobile gamepad. A nice bonus is the manual in Ukrainian (only in Ukrainian). It is clear from the box that GamePro MG650 was made specifically for the Ukrainian market, as we did not find even a single inscription in russian. The instruction is as simple as possible, because GamePro MG650 has a minimum number of operating modes, which will be its advantage and disadvantage at the same time, but more on that below. The main thing is that even an elderly person or a child who has never picked up such a device will have no trouble figuring out how to connect it. 
Samsung Electronics announced a new high-bandwidth memory chip that has the «highest capacity» in the industry. The South Korean giant claims that the HBM3E 12H «increases performance by more than 50%». AI service providers are increasingly requiring HBMs with higher capacity, and our new HBM3E 12H product was developed to meet this need.This new memory solution is part of our commitment to develop core technologies for high-stack HBMs and provide technology leadership in the high-capacity storage market in the AI era. Samsung Electronics is the world’s largest manufacturer of dynamic random access memory chips used in consumer devices such as smartphones and computers. Generative AI models, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, require a large number of high-performance memory chips. They enable generative AI models to remember details of past conversations and user preferences to generate human-like responses. Samsung reported that it has already started providing samples to customers, and mass production of the HBM3E 12H is scheduled for the first half of 2024. In September, Samsung signed a deal to supply Nvidia with its high-bandwidth memory chips, transmits CNBC. The HBM3E 12H has a 12-layer stack, but uses an advanced heat-compression non-conductive film that enables 12-layer products to be as tall as 8-layer products to meet current HBM packaging requirements. The result is a chip that contains more capacity in the same physical dimensions.
Along with presentation of the global versions of Xiaomi 14 and 14 Ultra smartphones The Chinese company also introduced several other mobile devices.
The Xiaomi Pad 6S Pro tablet has entered global markets along with smartphones. It features a 12.4-inch IPS display with a 12-bit matrix, 3048×2032 pixel resolution, 144Hz refresh rate, HDR10, Dolby Vision, and 900 nits of peak brightness. The device has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, 8 or 12 GB of RAM, 256 or 512 GB of internal storage. The battery capacity is 10000 mAh. It supports 120 W fast charging.

The watch features a Snapdragon W5+ Gen 1 processor, sensors for heart rate and SpO2 monitoring, and a GPS module. The device runs on Wear OS. The price of Xiaomi Watch 2 is €200.
Xiaomi Watch S3 smartwatch was also launched on the global market. Despite the general similarities with the Xiaomi Watch 2 and Watch 2 Pro, this model does not use Google Wear OS but is based on the HyperOS platform, which means that it does not have apps that can be downloaded to expand its functionality. The watch is made in an aluminum case and has a 1.43-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 466×466 pixels. There are also sensors for measuring heart rate and SpO2, but there is no GPS module. The price of Xiaomi Watch S3 is €150.
The Band 8 Pro fitness tracker is also entering the global market. Compared to its predecessor, this model has a larger 1.74-inch AMOLED display with higher brightness and resolution. It is also reported to have 5 ATM water protection, heart rate and SpO2 sensors, GPS and NFC modules. Autonomy reaches 14 days on a single charge. The recommended retail price of Xiaomi Band 8 Pro is €70.
At MWC, Tecno not only announced the Pova 6 Pro gaming smartphone, but also expanded its product range beyond the smartphone industry. In Barcelona, the company presented Pocket Go, a wireless augmented reality gaming set, and Dynamic 1, a robotic dog.
Tecno Pova 6 Pro is equipped with a 6nm Dimensity 6080 chip and 8 or 12 GB of RAM. The chip is octa-core: two productive Cortex-A76 cores with a clock speed of 2.4 GHz and six Cortex-A55 cores with a clock speed of 2.0 GHz. Mali-G57 MC2 is responsible for graphics processing, transmits GSMArena. Pova 6 Pro has a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a refresh rate of 120 Hz and a large 6000 mAh battery (1000 mAh more than its predecessor) with support for 70W charging and 10W reverse charging. The Pova 6 Pro has a translucent design with two color options (Meteorite Gray or Comet Green), which Tecno calls Dynamic-Tech Design. Under the transparent back panel of the phone is a texture that replicates the electronics of a smartphone and a series of LEDs called Dynamic-Light Effect. There are 210 LEDs in total and 9 lighting modes with 101 user-defined effects to choose from. On the back of Tecno Pova 6 Pro are three cameras, the main one — 108MP, which provides 3x zoom (and up to 10x digital zoom). Other modules include a 2-megapixel depth sensor and an AI camera. The front has a 32-megapixel front camera with its own LED flash
Tecno Pocket Go — is a portable console running on the Windows operating system and designed to work with a pair of AR glasses — a new and unprecedented combination. The headset is equipped with a 0.71-inch microOLED screen, which should provide the effect of a 215-inch TV from a distance of six meters. The console itself is essentially inside a gamepad similar in layout to an Xbox controller. Tecno has claimed an 8-core 16-thread processor with a frequency of up to 5.1 GHz. It also has a cooling fan and three copper tubes for heat dissipation, as well as a replaceable battery. The glasses are called AR Pocket Vision and feature a six-axis gyroscope with an artificial intelligence algorithm that detects head movements.
The design of this robot is supposed to resemble a German shepherd dog. Its goal is to *provide smart home entertainment, assistance, education, and training. Tecno said it is «the ideal home companion of the future». The Dynamic 1 has a torque of 45 Nm/kg, and the dog can easily climb stairs, bow and give a paw. The HyperSense Fusion System artificial intelligence system and Intel Real Sense D430 depth camera allow it to recognize and avoid obstacles. The robot is equipped with an 8-core Arm processor, the name of which has not been specified. The dog has 64 GB of storage, Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2, and can be controlled via a smartphone app, as well as supporting remote control and voice commands. The Dynamic 1 has a 15,000 mAh battery for 90 minutes of operation and can be replaced and charged separately to minimize downtime.
Samsung has finally presented its smart ring at the Mobile World Conference 2024 and revealed some additional features. Galaxy Ring rendering for the first time were shown at the Galaxy Unpacked event last month — and at that time it was only known that the smart ring was primarily intended to monitor the health and well-being of the user. At today’s presentation, the device was not allowed to be photographed (although Samsung provided a few additional shots), but it was reported that it will be available in three colors (platinum-silver, gold, and black) when it arrives in stores later in 2024. The ring will also be offered in several sizes — which will determine the size of the battery (and thus the time between charges), ranging from 14.5 mAh to 21.5 mAh. The battery life is unknown, but for example, competitive Oura can work up to seven days between charges. Samsung Vice President Hong Park notes that the Galaxy Ring will monitor sleep patterns based on heart rate, movement, and breathing, and provide reports and advice to users. The company will also collect data from Natural Cycles, which already tracks menstrual cycles and ovulation via Galaxy Watch. The Galaxy Ring will be part of the Samsung Health ecosystem and is compatible with the Galaxy Watch — so you can use the devices simultaneously and get more accurate data. At the same time, the smart ring has some advantages over the watch — at least in that it is more comfortable to sleep with. The exact set of sensors, price, and launch date are to be announced in the coming months. Galaxy Ring will be compatible only with Samsung Galaxy phones, although the company plans to integrate it with other Android devices later. Compatibility with iOS is still being determined. 
A slim, elegant, well-built, quiet, and beautiful gaming laptop sounds fantastic, but let’s take the Lenovo Legion Slim 7 as an example to see if it’s possible. Of course, the slim design has brought serious compromises, so let’s talk not only about the advantages of the device, but also about the main problems. We tested the laptop in work tasks, video games, measured battery life, noise, heating, evaluated the quality of the display, camera, ergonomics, and other key functional components. Pluses: high-quality aluminum case; almost identical performance from the battery and power supply; efficient cooling system and moderate noise level; excellent ergonomics, interfaces; good display. Minuses: low performance per one hryvnia compared to «fatter» gaming models; power reduction by 45-50 W under load due to trotting; considerable cost despite the lack of licensed Windows in the package;
At MWC 2024, Xiaomi unveiled the global versions of its flagship smartphones Xiaomi 14 and 14 Ultra. The Chinese announcement of these devices took place a little earlier. The smaller version of Xiaomi 14 has a 6.36-inch LTPO display with a refresh rate of 120 Hz and a resolution of 2670×1200 pixels. At the same time, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra version has a 6.73-inch panel with a 1440p resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. In both cases, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is used. The amount of RAM starts at 12 GB, and the built-in storage capacity starts at 256 GB. The battery capacity in the standard model is 4610 mAh, and in the Ultra version it is 5300 mAh. Xiaomi’s new flagships are focused on photography, so the most interesting thing about them is the camera modules. The main camera of the Xiaomi 14 Ultra is based on the Sony LYT-900 inch sensor and includes the variable aperture system introduced on the Xiaomi 14 Pro. It allows you to change the aperture value in the range between f/1.63 and f/4.0 with 1024 aperture steps. According to journalists from The Verge, who attended a demonstration of this system, it does close the aperture. However, even in the most open state, the camera provides a depth of field comparable to full-frame cameras at f/4.0. The 14 Ultra features two telephoto modules with 3.2x and 5x zoom. In both cases, an image stabilization system is available. The camera supports video recording in the Log profile and 10-bit HDR in Log. For smartphones, you can use an optional grip that makes the device look like a compact camera. Additionally, this accessory can be used as an external battery. The main camera of the Xiaomi 14 is based on three 50-megapixel sensors, which are used in the main, ultra-wide-angle and telephoto (3.2x) modules. The new Xiaomi 14 and 14 Ultra smartphones are already available for pre-order in global markets (excluding the US) at a price of €999 and €1499, respectively. In Ukraine, the Xiaomi 14 model in the 12/512 GB memory configuration is already available for UAH 44999 (during the first week, the preferential price is UAH 39999). The Xiaomi 14 Ultra version will go on sale in Ukraine at the end of March. 
Almost five years ago Energizer was trying to sell a smartphone, or rather a power bank with 18,000 mAh with a built-in phone. Now, Avenir Telecom (which owns the Energizer brand) has done it again, only this time they’ve put the smartphone in a 28,000 mAh battery. This is what is called progress. The device itself is called the Hard Case P28K, and like its predecessor, it will be sold under the Energizer brand. The company claims that the P28K’s battery is enough to last for a full week of regular use. The device is also IP69-rated tough enough to withstand any off-grid adventures you might want to take part in while away from a charging point. The talk time is 122 hours (or just over five days) and the standby time is 2252 hours—, which is almost 94 days, transmits The Verge. The downside is the absolute size. With a thickness of 27.8 mm and a weight of 570 g, the Hard Case P28K is more than three times the thickness and weight of the iPhone 15. It can be quickly charged with up to 33 watts, but the rest of the characteristics are more relevant to entry-level or mid-range smartphones. There’s no 5G, but a MediaTek MT6789 processor —, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, a trio of rear cameras, Android 14, and a 6.78-inch 1080p LCD display. Avenir Telecom plans to sell the Energizer Hard Case P28K for €249.99 when it goes on sale in October this year 
At MWC 2024, Lenovo presented Project Crystal — a laptop with a transparent screen (for some reason, they are popular in sci-fi movies) and a touch panel instead of a keyboard. The manufacturer also showed a line of more traditional ThinkPad and ThinkBook computers, but with a key for calling Microsoft Copilot artificial intelligence that is fashionable today. The company also offered Smart Connect software, developed together with Motorola, which should make it easier to manage tasks across devices. 
Lenovo’s Project Crystal — is probably the world’s first laptop with a transparent microLED display, which is an example of science fiction coming true. There are currently no plans to turn Project Crystal into a retail product. Instead, Lenovo’s latest concept device was commissioned by the ThinkPad division to explore the potential of transparent microLED panels and artificial intelligence integration. The most obvious use case would be to share information somewhere, such as a doctor’s office or hotel reception. Instead of turning the screen, you can use software to allow anyone on the other side to see it. In combination with the camera built into the back of the system, Lenovo says that augmented reality applications are possible. One example would be using the camera to identify an object, similar to Google Lens. And thanks to the transparent display, this idea can be developed further by overlaying a diagram or schematic on the object to troubleshoot or repair it, transmits Engadget. At first glance, the transparency effect is surprising. When closed or when the display is off, the Project Crystal screen looks almost like a regular piece of glass with a slight brown tint. But in a moment, it flashes like a Russian warship. The nominal brightness reaches 1000 nits, and Lenovo claims that peak values can reach 3000 nits, making it brighter than the new Galaxy S24. And despite the fact that the panel consists of several layers, it is thin, which helps to blur the line between the digital and analog worlds. Lenovo says it’s also considering adding some sort of contrast layer to turn it into a traditional opaque display at the touch of a button. However, for a relatively large 16-inch display, its resolution is not very high, so if you look closely, you can see individual pixels. Another design trick is that instead of a traditional keyboard, the Project Crystal is equipped with a touchpad similar to those used on older Yoga Books. It suffers from many of the same problems. The most obvious example of this is that hands drift while typing because there is no tactile feedback, resulting in reduced accuracy. Lenovo claims that in the future, AI will be able to solve this problem by learning human habits and then using this information to account for hand deviations from the initial line. But for now, it still remains a problem.
Lenovo is calling the updates to the ThinkPad T series and ThinkBook line «computers with artificial intelligence» because they all feature a special Microsoft Copilot button that provides instant access to the digital assistant. Among the announced models are — ThinkPad T14 Gen 5, ThinkPad T16 Gen 3, ThinkPad X12 Detachable Gen 2, and ThinkBook 14 «2 in 1» Gen 4. These computers are equipped with new Intel Core Ultra processors. The ThinkPad X12 Detachable Gen 2 boasts a sturdy 3:2 display with Corning Gorilla Glass and an Intel Core Ultra U processor. This tablet/laptop hybrid can be equipped with up to 32GB of RAM. The detachable backlit keyboard boasts a three-button trackpad, and the tablet is equipped with a 5-megapixel front-facing camera and an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera. The updated ThinkBook 14 «2 in 1» Gen 4 has an ultra-thin profile with a thickness of 16.85 mm, which is slightly thinner than the previous generation. It weighs about 1.6 kg. The 14-inch display has a 16:10 aspect ratio, and the keyboard unit — has a larger touchpad made of Mylar glass-like material, transmits Engadget. It also comes with a new Magnetic Slim Pen for thinner touchscreen control. The ThinkPad T14 Gen 5 will go on sale in April this year and will be available in several variants starting at $950. The ThinkPad T16 Gen 3 will also go on sale in April this year at a price starting at $1220. The ThinkPad X12 Detachable Gen 2 will be available in the same month with a starting price of $1,400. Finally, the ThinkBook 14 «2 in 1» Gen 4 will go on sale in March this year at a starting price of $1170. 
A new cross-device management tool called Smart Connect should allow users to easily switch tasks from one device to another. For example, you can transfer a podcast from your phone to your tablet using just a swipe gesture, or easily share files between connected devices using the unified Share Hub. The companies have not yet released the full list of compatible devices, but so far, Smart Connect will work with Lenovo PCs running Windows 10 or later and only some Lenovo tablets and Motorola devices. Smart Connect will allow you to switch between multiple devices with a single keyboard and mouse without interruption and receive synchronized notifications from all connected devices. It also offers a smart clipboard feature for all connected devices, so you can copy and paste items from one device to another. Smart Connect will also allow users to turn their phone into a hotspot for a connected tablet or PC, or use it as a webcam. Users will also be able to stream content from their phones to other connected devices, for example, to watch videos on a big screen. Smart Connect will be available in a few months on the Microsoft Store and Google Play Store.
According to a report by Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, Apple’s future plans for wearables may include smart glasses with artificial intelligence and AirPods with cameras. Both concepts are at the «exploratory stage». The smart glasses will reportedly be equipped with many sensors, AI functions, and powerful batteries. Despite the fact that the device looks like a cheaper wearable gadget for the head (compared to Vision Pro), it is not positioned as a computer with augmented reality and high-quality transparent displays. Instead, Gurman compares Apple’s idea to Ray-Ban by Meta, which have a camera and an AI assistant but no display. Apple also reportedly started looking into camera-equipped AirPods last year, under the codename B798. They are likely to have the same dimensions as the current version — but will be equipped with low-resolution cameras and will also use artificial intelligence to help users with their daily routines. Gurman also mentions Apple’s long-standing plans for a smart ring, which still have their supporters in Cupertino, but are not in active development.
Human Mobile Devices, known as HMD, is working with Mattel to launch a Barbie flip phone and a smartphone under the HMD brand. Earlier, the company announced the HMD Fusion strategy — the development of new smartphones with various partners. No prices, specifications or features of the Barbie phone, which has not yet been officially named, have been announced. It is known that it will be a traditional flip phone, not a smartphone — according to the company itself: «Smartphones are loved because they offer a digital detox solution in a world where nearly four in ten (38%) young people aged 16-24 are concerned about spending too much time with their smartphones. In the United States alone, one-third of millennials are actively trying to limit their time on social media, and their fear of missing out (FOMO) is gradually decreasing. The demand for push-button phones is growing as young people decide to limit the time spent on smartphones for the sake of their mental health. The so-called «screenagers» have appeared on TikTok, and their hashtag #bringbackflipphones has garnered 60.2 million views». As for the own-brand phone, the company hasn’t announced any details yet, but it is known that it will also appear this summer. The company also says that it plans to «bring back the iconic phone this summer», possibly another Nokia. 
The modern market is oversaturated with a choice of products. That’s why we decided to come to the rescue and compiled the top gaming mouse in 2024. We have selected the best models for various game genres and any budget. What criteria to consider when choosing a gaming mouse? Every player wants to get the most out of their «tame rodent». Manufacturers offer many different options, among which the main ones are: Shape and weight; Connection type (wired, wireless, combined); Availability of additional buttons; Quality and characteristics of the sensor; Other components; Price. To have a clear understanding of what your future gaming mouse will be like, you need to understand what tasks it should perform. It depends on what games you play. The above characteristics may differ from this. But it will all come down to your budget. 
There’s no single answer to the question of which mouse is the most comfortable. Everyone has different hands, and everyone has to choose the shape and weight that suits them. There is no one type of mouse for everyone! Ultra-lightweight mice that weigh 60-70 grams are gaining popularity. Such devices are chosen by professional players, because when you spend long hours at the computer, you need to surround yourself with comfortable devices that will not exhaust you. On the other hand, heavy mice (90+ grams) usually have more settings, including a larger number of buttons (such mice will be useful for those who use many macros). In addition, some heavy mice have additional «weights» that make the rodent even heavier. But the choice of mouse shape is a higher priority. If you look at any mouse manufacturer, they offer us several shapes. Let’s take a look at Razer: asymmetrical and ergonomic, narrow and symmetrical, large, heavy, but has many additional buttons, ergonomic and asymmetrical with a comfortable place for the thumb.
Palm grip: One of the most popular types, in which your hand rests entirely on the surface of the mouse. Its popularity is explained by the natural positioning of the hand. These mice are usually quite large and ergonomic. Although they are comfortable, they are not suitable for people who need maximum precision. Fingernail grip: In this type of grip, the hand forms an arc, reducing the number of points of contact with the mouse. Such mice are slightly shorter than traditional palm grip mice, which makes for more precise movements. Such mice are popular among RTS players. Fingertip grip: this type is quite rare. Manipulators designed for fingertip grip are lightweight, have a very shortened body, and a subtle curve.
This top list will focus exclusively on optical gaming mice, which are optimal for gamers and have proven themselves. Among the advantages of this type are their variability and a wide range of DPI settings (a standard used to measure the sensitivity of a mouse, expressed as a measurement of dots per 1 inch (2.54 cm) that the device can perceive).
But what DPI values do we need to realize that this mouse is a worthy choice? For normal use, 3200 DPI is enough. But those who like to play games should choose multi-range mice. Some models have a range of up to 16,000 DPI and even more. Therefore, it is best to choose a mouse with a maximum value of 8000 DPI. It’s also worth noting that users who spend hours playing games, especially shooters, often set the mouse to 400-800 DPI to ensure clarity.
Polling rate: determines how many times the mouse checks the cursor position in 1 second. Measured in Hz, optimally 500-1000 Hz. Acceleration: Measures the amount the mouse can withstand before the sensor breaks. The optimal value is 20 g. IPS: The maximum speed at which the sensor can read its location. The optimal value is 200-220 IPS. 
Today’s review is about a TV, but not just any TV, it’s a TV for kids. Let’s take a look at Kivi KidsTV — a 32-inch Full HD model with a body that can be used to mount a construction set, a shockproof screen, a built-in nightlight, and more. We have been testing this new product for several weeks and are now ready to share our experience, tests, and impressions. Pluses: design that children like; unusual body with grooves for children's construction sets; adequate image with HDR support; screen is protected by tempered glass; Low Blue Light function; built-in night light; Smart TV with built-in convenient Kivi applications; good sound; convenient and medium-sized remote control. Minuses: the screen does not display true black, but only dark gray, because it is not Mini LED; you need to get used to the important volume buttons in the «swing» format; mediocre hardware.

Xiaomi has a new flagship smartphone. Announced in China, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra has a number of interesting photographic features, including a main camera with a large inch sensor (specifically, Sony LYT-900) and a variable aperture of 1024 stops ranging from f/1.63 to f/4.0. Prices start at 6,499 yen (about $904) for 12 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, and go up to 7,799 yen (about $1,084) for 16 GB of RAM and 1 TB of storage when the phone goes on sale on February 27. There is also a special titanium model that will cost 8,799 yen (about $1,224). The international launch of the phone is not long away. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said that the phone will appear at the company’s presentation at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, where it will be presented alongside Xiaomi 14 and 14 Pro, which was launched in China in October last year, transmits The Verge. Emphasizing the phone’s photographic capabilities, Xiaomi is bringing back a special photography kit for the 14 Ultra that adds a pen and shutter button to the phone. The pen connects via USB-C and contains an additional 1500 mAh battery and customizable controls that can be used to adjust aperture, shutter speed, or ISO. But the accessory is not as important as what happens inside the phone, where, in addition to the main 50-megapixel sensor, there are three additional 50-megapixel cameras: a telephoto with 3.2x optical zoom, a periscope with 5x optical zoom, and an ultra-wide-angle camera with a field of view of 122 degrees. These cameras are housed in a large round protrusion, rather than a square one like the 14 and 14 Pro. Like the 14 and 14 Pro, the 14 Ultra is also powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3and its screen has the same specifications as the 14 Pro: 6.73-inch diagonal, 1440p resolution, maximum refresh rate, and peak brightness of 120 Hz and 3,000 nits, respectively. The device is protected against dust and water to the IP68 standard. Where the 14 Ultra really has an advantage over the 14 Pro is in battery capacity. It is 5300 mAh, not 4880 mAh, although surprisingly, the maximum fast charging power — is 90 watts, not 120 watts, as in the 14 Pro. The 14 Ultra can also be charged wirelessly at up to 80W. 
Sony, following Google, Apple, Microsoft, and many others, has taken a step towards a password-free future — PlayStation owners have been given the opportunity to log in to their PSN accounts using Passkeys Sony now allows sign into your PlayStation account without a password and testing PSVR 2 support for PC, which should eventually completely replace classic passwords and less secure two-factor authentication (2FA) technology. What access keys are and why they are — have been described repeatedly in previous texts (1 and 2). It is a simple alternative to passwords that allows you to securely log in using your own device — using your fingerprint, face recognition or PIN to unlock the screen. The key benefits of the technology are — convenience (no need to remember long and complex passwords), speed (authorization is faster than with a password), increased security (access keys are stored locally and synchronized between devices via a cloud service) and resistance to phishing attacks. Microsoft has opened general access to fully passwordless authentication, including for Xbox owners, at the end of 2021, in the fall of 2023, Nintendo added support for access keys, and now PlayStation has caught up with the competition. To create and use an access key to log in to PSN, you need to activate the function in your account settings in the Security section.

Google has told suppliers to start manufacturing its Pixel smartphones in India no earlier than next quarter, as part of its plan to ship more than 10 million Pixel phones this year. Last October, Google said that will start production of smartphones in Indiaand its flagship smartphone Pixel 8 will be available there in 2024 as it focuses on a key growth market. The move will also help Google diversify its supply chain away from China, transmits Reuters. The tech giant will prepare production lines for its flagship Pixel 8 Pro smartphones in the coming weeks and will start producing the phones in April-June, the report said, citing familiar with the matter sources. The report does not say how many phones Google plans to produce in India, nor whether these smartphones will be sold in the country or exported.
The relatively new Intel Foundry division has received an important order from a large company, namely Microsoft. CEO Satya Nadella has announced that his company will use Intel’s latest 18A (1.8 nm) process technology for future in-house chip development. But given Intel’s process roadmap, this means that we are not likely to see a new Microsoft chip until 2025. Although neither company has disclosed the nature of the silicon in question, Microsoft has unveiled its own server chips Azure Maia AI Accelerator and Azure Cobalt 100 CPU last November, with an expected rollout sometime early this year. Cobalt 100 is based on Arm’s architecture, and Intel happened to optimize its 18A process for Arm’s design since April last year (it even became an investor in Arm later), so there is a good chance that this collaboration could lead to the next generation Cobalt processor, transmits Engadget. In addition to the usual efficiency gains from shrinking the node size, the Intel 18A also offers an «industry-first backplane power solution» that separates the power interconnect layer from the data interconnect layer at the top and moves the former below the silicon substrate. This allows for better voltage regulation and reduced resistance, resulting in faster logic and lower power consumption, especially in 3D stacking. During Intel’s Q4 financial results call, CEO Pat Gelsinger reiterated expectations that «18A will reach production readiness in the second half of ’24». Given that Intel’s own 18A-based processors — Clearwater Forest for servers and Panther Lake for clients — won’t be available until 2025, this is likely to be the timeframe for Microsoft’s chip as well.
In this article, we will review the best gaming monitors in Ukraine in the form of ten models from ten well-known brands. Only Quad HD 2560×1440 models with a high refresh rate were taken into account, keeping the price range under UAH 10,000. It can be considered that 2K is the golden mean for a modern gamer. It is this resolution that has become a kind of new standard for 2024, despite the considerable popularity of Full HD. 
It is still unknown when Apple Vision Pro will appear in official retailers, so the ball is in the court of «gray» sellers who bring the «technology of the future» closer as best they can. Sales of Vision Pro in the United States started on February 2, 2024. The United States is still the only country where Vision Pro can be bought officially: prices start at $3499 (excluding taxes) for the minimum 256 GB of storage, the 512 GB version costs $3699, and 1 TB — $3899. The gadgets are currently being imported to Ukraine and other countries by resellers, who, of course, charge a hefty markup. At the same time, prices for Apple Vision Pro in Ukraine have gone down over the past week.

Insider Kamila Wojciechowska has shared new details about the upcoming Google Pixel 8A smartphone. This device is expected to have a display with a 120 Hz refresh rate (compared to 90 Hz in the Pixel 7A) and a higher brightness. Wojciechowska claims that the next model in the Pixel line of budget phones will have 1400 nits of peak brightness, compared to 1000 nits in the 7A, as well as limited support for DisplayPort output via USB-C. At the same time, the camera is not expected to improve, as it is said that Google will carry over last year’s cameras to the 8A. Previous leaks suggested that the Pixel 8A will feature updated rounded corners like the Pixel 8 and a Tensor G3 chip. The smartphone will retain the 6.1-inch display size of the 7A. Wojciechowska’s new post confirms these previous leaks. The Pixel 8A is also said to have 256 GB of internal storage. Taken together, all these changes are rumored to make the Pixel 8A look like a smaller and cheaper version of the Pixel 8. Google gave the Pixel 8 version access to fewer AI features than the Pixel 8 Pro. Wojciechowska says that the Tensor G3 processor in the new 8A will be hotter than the G3 that powers the Pixel 8. This raises the question of how many AI features will be available to owners of the cheaper phone. Won’t it turn out that the more affordable Pixel 8A will be a more interesting purchase than the standard Pixel 8? As expected, the official announcement of the Pixel 8A smartphone will take place during the Google I/O 2024 conference scheduled for May 14.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the company plans to sell its Blackwell GPU accelerator for artificial intelligence and HPC workloads at $30-40 thousand. However, this is an approximate price, as Nvidia is more inclined to sell the entire stack of data center components, not just the GPU accelerator itself. The performance of the Blackwell-based Nvidia B200 accelerator with 192 GB of HBM3E memory is undoubtedly impressive. But these figures are achieved thanks to the design of a chipset with chips containing 204 billion transistors (104 billion per chip). This solution will cost significantly more than a single-chip GH100 accelerator with 80 GB of memory. According to Raymond James analysts, each H100 costs about $3100, while each B200 should cost about $6000. Developing the GB200 was not cheap, and Nvidia’s costs for modern GPU architecture and design exceed $10 bln, according to the company’s CEO. Last year, Nvidia partners were selling H100s for $30-40 thousand when demand for these accelerators was at its peak and supply was limited by TSMC’s production capacity. It is worth keeping in mind that Nvidia does not really want to sell B200 modules or cards. Instead, it might be much more inclined to sell DGX B200 servers with eight Blackwell GPUs or even DGX B200 SuperPODs with 576 B200 GPUs for millions of dollars each. Jensen Huang emphasized that the company would prefer to sell supercomputers or DGX B200 SuperPODS with a lot of hardware and software, which have premium prices. Therefore, the company does not list B200 cards or modules on its website, but only DGB B200 and DGX B200 SuperPOD systems. 
According to knowledgeable sources, Apple plans to maximize the display size in the upcoming iPhone 16 series smartphones using a new ultra-thin bezel technology. Apple will use Border Reduction Structure (BRS) technology to minimize the bezel at the bottom of the display. BRS achieves this by rolling up the internal copper wiring into a more compact package. The company plans to use the bezel-less display technology on all four iPhone 16 models, which are due out in the second half of this year. According to available information, Apple has already tried to apply this technology to the iPhone, but previous attempts were curtailed due to heating problems. But thanks to recent improvements in heat dissipation technology, the company has returned to the idea of introducing BRS. Last year, Apple reduced the bezels on iPhone 15 Pro models using LIPO technology. This reduced the bezels (from 2.2 mm on iPhone 14 models) to 1.5 mm. It is also reported that the new iPhone 16 Pro models will have significantly larger display sizes than the current iPhone 15 Pro versions. It is expected that the iPhone 16 Pro will have a 6.27-inch display (159.31 mm), and the iPhone 16 Pro Max will have a 6.85-inch display (174.06 mm). With the increase in display size, the size of the iPhone body will also increase. The iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max will be slightly taller and wider than their predecessors. This will increase the internal space for components. For example, iPhone 16 Pro models may receive larger and more durable batteries. The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models are expected to remain the same size and match the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. However, with the release of the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Plus in 2025, Apple is also expected to introduce larger display sizes of 6.27 and 6.86 inches for its standard iPhone models. 
The recent leak of the PS5 Pro (codenamed Trinity) specifications finally dispelled all doubts — Sony’s new console will be released this fall. What exactly can gamers expect from the mid-gen?

Realme has announced the launch of the realme 12 Pro Series 5G smartphones in Ukraine. This line is aimed at mobile photography enthusiasts. The realme 12 Pro Series 5G smartphones have a 6.7-inch Curved Vision OLED display with a refresh rate of 120 Hz and a peak brightness of 950 nits. The devices provide a screen-to-body ratio of 93%. The display displays a spectrum of 1.07 billion shades and covers 100% of the P3 gamut. The fingerprint scanner is located below the display.
Microsoft is working on an updated version of the Xbox game console. The South Korean Radio Research Agency (RRA) recently certified the new Xbox Development Kit (XDK) for testing. As a rule, such certifications precede the launch of a new product several months in advance. In the case of the Xbox 360, the certification came only a month before its release. 
Despite a lot of speculation, it is not known what kind of console it might be. Various sources and leaks suggest an updated Xbox Series X in all-white color with no disk support or a rumored portable version of the Xbox. It could also be an all-digital Xbox Series X or even an Xbox Series Pro. Only the codename of the new device is known — Xbox Series X «Brooklyn». However, Microsoft is unlikely to announce a new generation console. According to the company, it should be expected no earlier than 2026. The last time Xbox vice president Sarah Bond officially commented on the hardware update was in February: «There are some exciting things coming to the hardware that we’re going to share at this year’s holiday season». The photo above is the current version of XDK. it is not known what the new kit or the new console will look like.
